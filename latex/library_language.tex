\section{Library Language}
The Domain Specific Language (DSL) we have created is an attempt at modelling a Library system. We have a chosen the context of a public library as opposed to a specialised facility such as a university or law library. The DSL is naturally constrained by our development tool and as such  is comprised of three main entities: Objects, Relationships and Roles. These entities are described in the following sections. 

\subsection{Objects}
Objects represent physical entities such as loanable items, library equipment and people such as library users and employees. Examples of Objects within the system include a book shown in Figure~\ref{fig:objbook}, people such as Author shwon in

\subsection{Relationships}
Relationships describe methods by which objects within the DSL may interact.

\subsection{Roles}
 Roles define constraints on the types of objects that may mutually INHABIT? TAKE THE PLACE IN THE RELATIONSHIP, ?BE?, ?RESIDE? word please  end of a relationship between those objects. 


\subsection{Constraints}
 Additionally constraints may be defined surrounding the semantics of relationships. These constraints fall into four categories:
Connectivity: cardinality and type of some shit about the thing with a thing. 
Occurrence: constraint surrounding the number of a unique objects may appear in a graph
Uniqueness: uniqueness constraints for property values such as ID etc
Port: No fucking idea what the shit port was for, probably something to do with ships.
Creating and applying constraints allows further development and enrichment of DSL semantics.
