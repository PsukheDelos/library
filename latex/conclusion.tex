\section{Conclusion}
Our initial investigation into MetaEdit+ seemed to suggest that it was an ideal tool for our purposes.  However, we quickly learned that the overall work flow of MetaEdit+ has a steep learning curve.  As we progressed, the work flow did become easier, but this was only with research, practice, and time.  While experts may find this tool incredibly handy, novices will continue to struggle as it hasn't quite made the process intuitive.  MetaEdit+ shows a lot of promise, and although it has been around for years, it still has not quite cracked the winning formula.
