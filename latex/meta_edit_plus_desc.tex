\section{MetaEdit+}
With MetaEdit+ an experienced developer defines a domain specific language containing the domain’s concepts and rules in a metamodel, and specifies the mapping from that to code in a domain-specific code generator. For the modeling language implementation, MetaEdit+ provides a metamodeling tool suite for defining the language concepts, rules, symbols, checking reports and generators. Next to the user’s guide, developers are able to watch several webcasts, read articles, blogs, brochures and even listen to podcasts. Generally, Metacase provides really good and clear documentation, but some points could certainly be refined.

\subsection{Documentation provided}
MetaEdit+ offers various DSM resources. This includes a detailed Workbench User’s Guide which discusses every aspect of metamodeling in MetaEdit+. All methods provided by the API are described as well. A single point of criticism in the guide is the rather brief explanation of the API methods and the few examples it delivers.
