In software engineering, there are many approaches for handling the kind of complexities that emerge during development.  One such approach is the use of domain-specific languages within the context of model driven development.  As model driven development has become increasingly popular, new tools have emerged with the aim of allowing users to quickly, easily, and effectively create domain-specific languages.  However, these tools are still far from mainstream.  In this paper, we critique the usability of one such metacase tool, MetaEdit+, by defining a domain-specific language for a library system, describing the creation of this language using MetaEdit+, and reviewing our final result.
